# 🛒 Ecommerce Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior in an e-commerce platform to identify key factors that contribute to customer churn (when customers stop purchasing).  
Through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning models**, the project predicts whether a customer is likely to churn.  
The insights can help businesses design better retention strategies and boost profitability.

## 📂 Dataset
- **E comm.xlsx** – Contains customer information, purchase history, and engagement details.  

## 🔑 Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning and preparing the dataset.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identifying patterns in customer demographics, purchases, and engagement.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Selecting and transforming features relevant to churn prediction.  
4. **Model Building** – Applying Machine Learning algorithms to predict churn.  
5. **Evaluation** – Assessing model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Excel Dataset**  

## 🚀 Results
- Identified major factors affecting churn.  
- Built predictive models to classify customers as "Churn" or "Not Churn".  
- Generated insights to improve customer retention strategies.  

## 📊 Applications
- Helps businesses **reduce churn rate**.  
- Improves **customer engagement** and **profitability**.  
- Provides a foundation for advanced analytics like **customer lifetime value (CLV)**.  

## 📁 Files in Repository
- `Ecommerce_Customer_Churn_Analysis_and_Prediction.ipynb` – Project notebook.  
- `E comm.xlsx` – Dataset.  

## ✨ Future Scope
- Deploy as a **web app/dashboard** for business users.  
- Integrate with real-time customer data.  
- Experiment with **deep learning models**.
